# SA-in-FlowShopProblem

I proposed and implemented a **data-adaptive** simulated annealing algorithm to solve Flow-Shop Problem, and did some visulization.

The ./src folder includes the source code and datasets, more details can be seen in report.pdf.

Data format:
1. first row includes 2 integers: number of items: n, number of machines: m
2. the following n row include m pairs data(machine serial number and process time, seperated by space), seperated by space.

It's a course capstone in \<Optimization method\> in summer of 2022, my sophomore year. In retrospect, it's simple, like a toy, may not be so effective or novel. But it's my first time to implement Python and I spent several days looking the results flashing in the terminal, pondering what else can be done to improve my algorithm.
  
That period of time is treasurable, I felt happy, fulfilled and hopeful for my future, without much worry, uncertainty, anxiety, always expecting tomorrow, focusing on the present. Much thanks to the lecturer: Prof Yu. At the moment, night on 23th, Feb, 2022, I write down these words, and hope to regain my good mood and thoughts. FIND MYSELF.
